rem trustcert.cmd - install the test certificate so a test-signed driver
rem will load. GUEST side, MUST BE ELEVATED. Run once per VM.
rem
rem     trustcert.cmd [path-to-xboxctl-test.cer]
rem
rem BOTH STORES ARE REQUIRED, and this is the usual reason a correctly
rem signed driver is still refused:
rem
rem   Root             makes the chain verifiable at all. Without it the
rem                    signature terminates in an untrusted root.
rem   TrustedPublisher makes Windows willing to LOAD it without asking.
rem                    Without it the chain verifies and the driver is
rem                    still blocked.
rem
rem The symptom of missing either is the same and it is not an error
rem message: pnputil /enum-drivers reports the package with
rem
rem     Signer Name:    Unknown
rem
rem while every healthy package names its signer. An unsigned kernel
rem driver cannot load on x64, and nothing inbox claims a Class_58
rem device, so the pad is left as an Unknown device in Device Manager.
rem
rem TEST SIGNING MUST ALSO BE ON, and on Win10/11 Secure Boot must be off
rem for it to take effect. This script checks and reports both; it does
rem not change them, because both need a reboot and that is your call.
