retab.py -- tabs for indentation, spaces for alignment.

The project convention: one indent level is one TAB, and any whitespace
beyond the structural indent - lining a continuation line up under an
open paren, the ' * ' of a block comment, an ASCII diagram inside a
comment - stays SPACES. That is what makes the source render correctly
at any tab width instead of only at four.

Usage:
    python tools/retab.py --check [PATH ...]    report, exit 1 if any file
                                                would change
    python tools/retab.py --fix   [PATH ...]    rewrite in place

With no PATH, walks src_drv/ and src_cfg/ for .c, .h, .cpp and .inc.

HOW THE SPLIT IS DECIDED

    tabs   = min(structural_depth, leading_spaces // 4)
    spaces = leading_spaces - 4 * tabs

structural_depth is the brace nesting depth at the start of the line,
counted with strings, character literals and comments masked out. The
min() is what separates the two cases:

  - a line indented to its own block depth converts entirely to tabs;
  - a continuation line indented FURTHER than its depth keeps the
    excess as spaces, so it stays aligned with whatever it was lined up
    under;
  - a line indented LESS than its depth - a case label, a goto label -
    converts only as far as it actually goes.

Because tabs*4 + spaces always equals the original leading space count,
the rendered result at a four-column tab stop is byte-for-byte what it
was. --check verifies exactly that by expanding the output back, so a
bug in the scanner is caught rather than committed.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY LEFT ALONE

  - docs/ and tools/*.py. The RFC documents in docs/ are specified in
    spaces (three-space bodies, four-space preformatted blocks) and
    asciify.py measures their columns; tabs there would be wrong. The
    Python is PEP 8.
  - lines whose leading whitespace is inside a string literal, which
    happens when a string is continued with a trailing backslash.
    Retabbing those would change the string.
