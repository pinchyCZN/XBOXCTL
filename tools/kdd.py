"""kdd.py -- a daemon that owns one long-lived kd.exe session.

    python tools/kdd.py --pipe adaptoid-dbg

Start it once, in its own console window, and leave it. It connects kd.exe
to the VM's named pipe and NEVER disconnects. Clients (tools/kdc.py) talk to
it over a local TCP socket and get debugger output back, so the pipe is
opened exactly once per VM boot no matter how many queries are run.

WHY A DAEMON AND NOT ONE kd PER QUERY. Two separate failures, both of which
leave the guest hung and unrecoverable without a VM restart:

  1.  QUITTING WHILE THE TARGET IS HALTED LEAVES IT HALTED. `qd` detaches the
      debugger but does not resume a broken-in target. The guest sits at the
      int 3 forever with nothing to release it, which looks exactly like a
      frozen VM. A script that breaks in with -b and ends with `qd` hangs the
      guest EVERY time. Resume with `g` first, and only then let go.

  2.  VirtualBox's pipe server does not always accept a second connection
      after a client disconnects, so the pipe appears wedged even with no kd
      running. Never disconnecting sidesteps this entirely.

THE TARGET RUNS BY DEFAULT. A batch breaks in, runs its commands, and
resumes, so the guest is frozen only for the few milliseconds the commands
take. Nothing here ever sends `q` or `qd`.

See docs/kernel-debugging.txt for the VM and guest setup this expects.
