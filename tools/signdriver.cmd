rem signdriver.cmd - sign a built driver with the test certificate.
rem
rem     tools\signdriver.cmd [Platform] [Configuration] [pfx-password]
rem
rem defaulting to x64 and Release. Run tools\mktestcert.cmd once first.
rem
rem It does two things, and BOTH are needed for a clean install:
rem
rem   1. Embedded-signs xboxctl.sys. This is what lets the kernel LOAD the
rem      driver at all once test signing is on.
rem   2. Builds xboxctl.cat from xboxctl.inf and signs that. This is what
rem      lets PnP INSTALL the package without declaring it unsigned.
rem
rem THE CATALOG STEP IS THE UNCERTAIN ONE, and it is worth knowing why
rem before you rely on it. The only Inf2Cat on this machine is WDK 7.1's,
rem whose newest /os value is 7_X64 - it predates Windows 8 and cannot
rem write a Windows 10 OS attribute. A catalog built that way is correctly
rem signed but claims the wrong platform, and whether a given Windows 10
rem build accepts it has NOT been tested here. If the install refuses,
rem section 6 of src_drv\README.txt lists what to try.
